# *not social media*

not scrollable (no home feeds, FYP)
no red dot icons as notifications
no comments allowed especially from stranger

if you have problem with me? call me!
if you don't have my number then you don't know or close to me enough to have problem with me (tom holland)

just post something about you, so when you meet with someone offline, you can share your not-social-media profile so they can prepare topic or know what you on to about.
